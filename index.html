      <h2 class="card-title">FLEXIDEV-Ramdev</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Baba Ramdev, the yoga guru turned FMCG tycoon, is a man of many talents—most notably, his ability to twist his body into knots while simultaneously untangling his corporate bank accounts. From preaching simplicity to running a billion-dollar empire, he’s mastered the art of turning deep breaths into deep pockets. Whether it’s selling "herbal cures" for everything under the sun or turning yoga into primetime entertainment, Ramdev’s entrepreneurial flexibility might just outshine his yogic one.

      <h2 class="card-title">GRANDMASTER-Ram Rahim</h2>
      <p>Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, self-proclaimed god-man and former head of Dera Sacha Sauda, is a bizarre mix of spiritual leader, wannabe pop star, and convicted criminal. From directing cringe-worthy movies where he played a superhero of himself to releasing music videos that made autotune cry, his talents are as questionable as his morals. While he promised salvation to millions of followers, his real legacy includes a laundry list of scandals, convictions, and enough courtroom drama to put a Bollywood scriptwriter to shame.</p>
